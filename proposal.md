# Project Proposal
In this project, we will explore evolutionary algorithms and physics simulations by creating a simulation of a car on a track (with obstacles, etc.) and using an evolutionary algorithm to improve its driving. Our MVP is an animated car that can somewhat realistically drive on a track when controlled by the user. Our stretch goal is an AI-controlled car that can quickly make a loop around a track that is created with a user's drawing.

**Learning Goals**
Aurora: Improve my Python programming skills and learn more phiiiiisacsss
Alex: Understand evolutionary algorithms better
Gretchen: Gain a better understanding of evolutionary algorithms and physics modeling
Adam: Learn how to genetically define how a car drives
Matt: Learn how to scaffold and handle working on a five-person project for six weeks

**Implementation Plan**
Libraries to use: pygame, DEAP, scipy/numpy/PIL

**Class framework:**
* Environment: Contains the physical "objects" in our simulation
* Map: Represents the map
* Visualization/display: Displays the car
* Car: Is a car. Can control its acceleration.
* Controller: Can detect walls and evolve the car.

**Project schedule**
Week 1: Create basic physics engine for driving the car, create basic display
Week 2: Write driving/collision detection functions for car (create our MVP)
Week 3: Begin implementing track creation, very basic AI control of the car
Week 4: Finish track creation things, make the evolutionary algorithm more complex
Week 5: Put everything together, add more complex physics to car driving
Week 6: Debug, refactor, make website, prepare for presentation
**Collaboration plan**
Our plan is to split up tasks among members using an Asana dashboard and meet together several times a week to handle blocking tasks.
**Risks**
Team members being busy/sick/unavailable, issues with getting evolutionary algorithms to work, handling programming between 5 people (we'll be using Github extensively, but it will still be tricky)
